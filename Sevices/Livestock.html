    <p><b>L</b>ivestock management refers to the process of taking care of domesticated animals that are raised for various purposes, such as food, fiber, and work. This includes managing the health, feeding, housing, and breeding of livestock to ensure their optimal productivity and welfare.

      Livestock management practices can vary depending on the type of animal being raised and the specific goals of the operation. Common livestock species that are managed include cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry.
      
      Good livestock management practices are essential for maintaining the health and well-being of animals, as well as ensuring the safety and quality of the products derived from them. This can involve proper nutrition, vaccination, disease prevention and treatment, and housing that meets the animals' specific needs. Effective livestock management can also help to minimize environmental impacts and ensure sustainable use of natural resources.
